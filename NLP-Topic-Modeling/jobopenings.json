We apply scientific rigor and creativity, succeeding where others may fail, and we invest in our communities, making the world better for generations to come. All of us share a common purpose: to solve the greatest challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\nOur 22,000 employees work at the forefront of scientific innovation to tackle critical challenges in security, human health, manufacturing, energy and environmental management. Battelles work is grounded in the belief that science, technology and a passion for excellence can make industries more competitive and the world a better place.\n\nWe are currently seeking a Machine Learning Researcher. This position located in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nPrimary Function\nWe are seeking a researcher with experience in CFD and machine learning (ML). The objective of this work is to accelerate CFD using the latest technological developments in ML and associated hardware. More specifically, the leading code for ML, Googles TensorFlow, will be linked to NETLs MFiX and the solvers will be augmented/replaced with machine learned or hybrid algorithms which significantly accelerate computational speed without sacrificing accuracy. The primary challenge in this work is developing the ML algorithms that can be generalizable, accurate enough, and fast enough to be useful. This requires a substantial amount of data and the right model forms, as well as computing resources to train the models. The work also requires intimate knowledge of the workings of ML and data science. Having a strong background in the workings of CFD is not enough; therefore, we need individuals with ML and data science backgrounds. For analytical CFD, ML algorithms are not likely to be accurate enough on their own. Therefore, hybrid algorithms are likely to be key to development.\nMajor Responsibilities\nAssisting in developing ML models that solve systems ordinary differential equations/partial differential equations (ODE/PDEs) in less time to a given accuracy than the competitive iterative solvers.\nImplementing TensorFlow based solvers to refine machine learned initial guesses as needed.\nBenchmarking the new solvers on a variety of the latest hardware for ML models and compare to the traditional solution methods.\nPresenting ideas and results to the research team.\nContributing to future research planning and assisting with proposals.\nWorking independently and collaboratively with members of the research team to meet milestones and deliverables.\nAssisting or leading efforts in writing research papers and creating conference presentations.\nPosition Requirements\nTHE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS MUST BE MET TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:\n\nA B.S. or advanced degree in computer science, mathematics, or engineering, or a related field.\nTwo or more years of prior relevant experience with CFD code development.\nKnowledge of how the matrices and source terms in CFD are formed for finite volume methods.\nTHE FOLLOWING IS DESIRED, BUT NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS POSITION:\n\nExperience in and a strong knowledge of Python.\nMachine Learning (ML) in TensorFlow knowledge.\nCFD experience using NETLs MFiX software.\nLegal Disclaimer\nThe above statements are intended to describe the nature and level of work being performed by people assigned to this job.
